option.fuse.cacheTime = Each value in this option is measured in seconds. To optimize DICOMFuse, \
  the following resources are cached: DICOM store folders, Study folders, Series folders, list of \
  Instances (first parameter in option), and opened Instances files (second parameter). Opened \
  Instance files are cached to the temporary folder in the user space on disk. Other objects are \
  cached to RAM. Cached files will be deleted if you close DICOMFuse or if the cached files \
  become out of date. If you delete an Instance file locally, the cache will be updated. If you \
  upload an Instance file, the cache will be updated.
option.fuse.cacheSize = Maximum cache size in megabytes for cached instances. The maximum file \
  size that can be downloaded/uploaded is cacheSize / 4
